This internet speed meter is a beautiful little extension made by me to ensure that people like me who are in constant need to know their internet speed get to have a extension on their browser to see the internet speed live in form of a floating window also as a popup window in the extension section of the browser. 
to Install the extension just clone the repository and add the folder of this extension project to the chrome's or any browser's extenison settings. 
tap the load unpacked button and just pin the extension, you are good to go!
